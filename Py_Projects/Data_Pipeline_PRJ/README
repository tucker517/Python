This is a simple project in which random data is generated in flask and 

To use the two scripts in this directory one must run the datagen_api.py script. Once this is done you need to run the ingest.py script
to send the data through a pipe to a target of your choosing. If this is a very large amount of data it is better to use a cloud server
or external drive capable of handling the quantity of data you choose to generate.
