To use the two scripts in this directory one must run the datagen_api.py script. Once this is done you need to run the ingest.py script
to send the data through a pipe to a target of your choosing. If this is a very large amount of data it is better to use a cloud server
or external drive capable of handling the quantity of data you choose to generate. The documentation for this code is in progress so check
back for updates if you are interested in the progression of this project.
