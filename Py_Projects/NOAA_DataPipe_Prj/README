This is a sample ETL project in which I create 3 scalable python scripts that perform extraction, loading and transformation on a NOAA RESTapi request for weather station data.

Configurability:
----------------
The datasouce

Mongo DB:
---------
The scripts use pymongo to establish a connection with a server instance of mongodb with authSource admin accessibiltiy.


Automation:
-----------
The _main.py script calls the generic methods of the classes creted using the extract, load, and transform script to automate the entire etl process.






As this code will be refactored and improved in the near future, please check back for updates regularly. Thank you!
