This is a basic script that generates a regression plot and R^2 value for a given data set with specified XY parameters.
You can run this script using the test csv included within this directory or edit the column name in line () to reflect the title of 
the columns you need to read. This script uses pandas, matplotlib, and numpy to accomplish the aforementioned.

The second script entitled Linear_RegressionML.py is a script that uses the library sklearn or sci-kit learn to do the same analysis
on data. However this script is much shorter and demonstrates the power of the sklearn library and its ability to perform regression analysis
efecctively after training.
